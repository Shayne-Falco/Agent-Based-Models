# Agent-Based Models
 
Testing various Agent-Based Modeling Packages.
Agent-based modeling was the first model I built for independent research into tumor growth in simulated mammograms. I developed a novel Agent-based modeling system in Java.

## Julia
I can't get it working. It might be a problem updating to the latest version.

## Python (Mesa)
Working well and easy to make changes
